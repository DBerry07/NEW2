		<p>My name is Jasmin Hinton and I am a junior double majoring in Computer Engineering 
		and Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. I have taken Foundations of Computer 
		Science which has given me the opportunity to gain experience with programming in C++. 
		This course provided me the chance to create a consistent program that dealt with call 
		records, which consisted of a cell number, rely stations and call lengths. Even though 
		the programming field is new to me, I am dedicated worker, determined to improve and 
		enhance the field technology. Through the current course I am taking, Principles of 
		Software Engineering, I intend on understandingthe design, development, and implementation
		 of software that is needed for the improvement of local, and global businesses.
