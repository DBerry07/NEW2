<h1>About Ryan</h1><br>

<p> My name is Ryan Connell. I am a senior pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and
a minor in Computer Science. While my passion is pure math and theory, I am also
interested in applied mathematics and programming. I hope to soon get a job
programming in some capacity while I complete my undergrad and go through graduate 
school.
<br><br>
Overtime at FAU I've learned C++ in Comp Sci classes, while learning Python and Julia in
my mathematics courses. Im hoping to expand my programming knowledge with Java next.
