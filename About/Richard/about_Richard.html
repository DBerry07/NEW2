			About Richard Altamore
		</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Richard Altamore, but almost everyone calls me Ricky. <br>
			I am a junior at FAU (Florida Atlantic University). <br>
			My major is Computer Engineering, but I am thinking of double-majoring in both Computer Engineering and Computer Science. <br>
			I prefer working with hardware a lot more than I do with software due to the fact that it keeps me active. <br>
			I am experienced in C++ due to the classes I took here at FAU. <br>
			A future goal of mine is to work on the hardware of robotics. <br>
			I hope to achieve that goal by being successful here at FAU.
