        <p>
            I am in my senior year in Computer Science. <br>
            I was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and have lived in South Florida for the last fifteen years.<br>
            I have a passion for programming and I am excited at the prospect of working as a software engineer,
            hopefully in the very near future.<br>
            I also have an strong interest in history and anthropology, and I hope someday to work in anthropology and/or archeology in some capacity.<br>
            I am very familiar with the programming languages C, C++, Java, and Python. <br>
            I have worked with the programming languages php, javascript, and MySQL. <br>
            I have had no professional programming experience.
